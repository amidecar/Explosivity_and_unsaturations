    "Smiles are very practical from a programming point of view, they are very easy for a machine to interprate. For a person, not so much, a chemist generally knows substances by their name. For this reason, it's important to give the possibility to input the IUPAC name of a molecule. The function takes as an input the name of the molecule on the form a string and returns its smiles"
