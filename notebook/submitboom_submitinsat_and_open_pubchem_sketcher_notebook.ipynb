    "The open_pubchem_sketcher function is a bit more interesting, it makes the open pubchem sketcher button work on both tabs. It opens another tab on your internet browser where you can draw any molecule you like. On the top of the skecther, the smiles of he molecule is given. You can copy it into the other functions. This can be very useful if you don't know the smiles nor the iupac name of a molecule bur you know its structure. This function requires the internet to work."
