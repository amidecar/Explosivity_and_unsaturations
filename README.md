<h2 align="center">
Determine if a compound is explosive and find its unsaturations.
</h2>

<br>

This program is made of two different parts.
The first one can determine if a molecule is explosive, gives the oxygen balance if it is, and highlights in the molecule where the explosible groups are.
The second part calculates the degree of unsaturation and highlights where these unsaturations are in the molecule.

## How to install the package

First, clone the respository on your own device

```
git clone https://github.com/amidecar/Explosivity_and_unsaturations
```

Select the environment in which you want to install the package or,
Create a new environment, you may also give the environment a different name. 

```
conda create -n explosivity_and_unsaturations python=3.10 
```

install the package from the cloned repository

```
conda activate explosivity_and_unsaturations
cd path/to/your/cloned/repository
(conda_env)  pip install .
```

If you need jupyter lab to use the package, install it
Or install any other code editor you like such as vscode or spyder

```
(explosivity_and_unsaturations) $ pip install jupyterlab
```

##  How to use the package

```python
#if you want to import only one function, in this example balox
from explosiosivity_and_unsaturations import balox

result_1 = balox(data)

#or import the whole package to get acces to every function
import explosivity_and_unsaturations as eau

result_2 = eau.function(data)
```

## Using that package on your own repository

Initialize Git (only for the first time). 

Note: You should have create an empty repository on `https://github.com:Chemikarl/explosivity_and_unsaturations`.

```
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial package upload"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin YOUR_PERSONAL_REMOTE_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

Then add and commit changes as usual. 

To install the package, run

```
(explosivity_and_unsaturations) $ pip install -e ".[test,doc]"
```

### How can I be sure the package works as intended?

To check if the code runs properly and give back the expected result, you can run this two lines in you terminal

```
(conda_env) $ pip install tox
(conda_env) $ tox
```
